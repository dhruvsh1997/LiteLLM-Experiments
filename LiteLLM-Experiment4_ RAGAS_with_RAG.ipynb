According to the OCP, these entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a module can be extended without altering its source code, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.\\n\\nIn Python, you can effectively implement the Open/Closed Principle using inheritance and interfaces. By creating new subclasses or interface implementations, you can add fresh functionalities without modifying the existing codebase.\\n\\n### Example in Python:\\n\\nLet's consider a scenario where you need to develop a system for calculating the area of various shapes. To illustrate the Open/Closed Principle, we can design a base class `Shape` with an `area` method that must be implemented by its subclasses.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Shape:\\n    def area(self):\\n        raise NotImplementedError(\\\"You should implement this method!\\\")\\n\\nclass Rectangle(Shape):\\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\\n        self.width = width\\n        self.height = height\\n\\n    def area(self):\\n        return self.width * self.height\\n\\nclass Circle(Shape):\\n    def __init__(self, radius):\\n        self.radius = radius\\n\\n    def area(self):\\n        return 3.14159 * (self.radius ** 2)\\n\\n# Function to calculate total area of shapes\\ndef calculate_total_area(shapes):\\n    total_area = 0\\n    for shape in shapes:\\n        total_area += shape.area()\\n    return total_area\\n\\n# Usage\\nshapes = [Rectangle(10, 5), Circle(7)]\\nprint(\\\"Total Area:\\\", calculate_total_area(shapes))\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Base Class (`Shape`)**: The `Shape` class serves as a foundation, defining the `area` method without implementing it. This indicates that subclasses must provide their own implementation.\\n\\n2. **Subclassing**: The `Rectangle` and `Circle` subclasses extend the `Shape` class, each delivering its unique implementation for the `area` method.\\n\\n3. **Extending Functionality**: If you need to incorporate a new shape, such as a `Triangle`, you can create a new class that extends `Shape` without modifying any existing code:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Triangle(Shape):\\n    def __init__(self, base, height):\\n        self.base = base\\n        self.height = height\\n\\n    def area(self):\\n        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height\\n\\n# Adding a new shape\\nshapes.append(Triangle(10, 5))\\nprint(\\\"Total Area after adding Triangle:\\\", calculate_total_area(shapes))\\n```\\n\\n### Key Points:\\n\\n- The original `Shape`, `Rectangle`, and `Circle` classes remain unaltered, conforming to the Open/Closed Principle.\\n- New functionality (calculating the area of triangles) is added by creating a new class (`Triangle`) instead of altering existing classes.\\n- This design enables you to extend the capabilities of your software without modifying existing code, thereby minimizing the risk of introducing bugs in already tested parts of the application.\",\n          \"Here is a refined version of your draft for accuracy and clarity:\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a fundamental SOLID principle in object-oriented design that emphasizes the importance of decoupling high-level modules from low-level modules by relying on abstractions. This principle is crucial for creating flexible, maintainable, and scalable systems.\\n\\nThe Dependency Inversion Principle is defined by two key tenets:\\n\\n1. **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions**: In a traditional approach, high-level modules that contain complex logic often depend on low-level modules that provide generic utilities. However, according to DIP, both high-level and low-level modules should depend on interfaces or abstract classes that define the required functionalities. This decoupling enables changes to low-level modules without affecting high-level modules.\\n\\n2. **Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions**: This tenet reinforces the idea that implementation details of low-level modules should be modular and interchangeable, as long as they adhere to the established abstractions. This way, changes to low-level modules do not impact high-level modules, which remain dependent on the abstraction.\\n\\n### Implementing the Dependency Inversion Principle in Python\\n\\nIn Python, you can implement DIP using abstract base classes (ABCs) or interfaces, along with dependency injection techniques. The following example illustrates this approach:\\n\\n#### Example: Notification System\\n\\nLet's consider a scenario in which we want to implement a notification system. The key is to ensure that our high-level module (`NotificationService`) does not depend on specific low-level implementations (`EmailSender` or `SmsSender`) but instead depends on an abstract notification interface.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\\n\\n# Define an abstract base class for notification\\nclass Notification(ABC):\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def send(self, message: str):\\n        pass\\n\\n# Low-level module: EmailSender\\nclass EmailSender(Notification):\\n    def send(self, message: str):\\n        print(f\\\"Sending email with message: {message}\\\")\\n\\n# Low-level module: SmsSender\\nclass SmsSender(Notification):\\n    def send(self, message: str):\\n        print(f\\\"Sending SMS with message: {message}\\\")\\n\\n# High-level module: NotificationService\\nclass NotificationService:\\n    def __init__(self, notifier: Notification):\\n        self.notifier = notifier\\n\\n    def notify(self, message: str):\\n        self.notifier.send(message)\\n\\n# Usage\\nemail_sender = EmailSender()\\nnotification_service_email = NotificationService(email_sender)\\nnotification_service_email.notify(\\\"Hello, this is an email notification.\\\")\\n\\nsms_sender = SmsSender()\\nnotification_service_sms = NotificationService(sms_sender)\\nnotification_service_sms.notify(\\\"Hello, this is an SMS notification.\\\")\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Abstraction**: We define an abstract base class `Notification`, which has an abstract method `send`. This class acts as an abstraction that both `EmailSender` and `SmsSender` must implement.\\n\\n2. **Low-level Modules**: The `EmailSender` and `SmsSender` classes implement the `Notification` interface, defining specific behaviors for sending notifications.\\n\\n3. **High-level Module**: The `NotificationService` class takes an instance of `Notification` through dependency injection (in its constructor). This means that it doesn't rely on a specific implementation of a notification; rather, it works with whatever concrete class implements the `Notification` interface.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: Thanks to this design, if you need to add a new type of notification, you simply create a new class that implements `Notification` without modifying the `NotificationService` class. This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, leading to a more flexible, maintainable, and scalable codebase.\",\n          \"Here is a refined version of the draft with improvements for accuracy and clarity:\\n\\nThe Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a fundamental concept in object-oriented design, ensuring that subclasses can seamlessly replace their base classes without compromising the correctness and reliability of the program. This principle is essential for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Behavioral Consistency**: LSP guarantees that subclasses preserve the behavior of their base classes, allowing them to be used as substitutes without affecting the program's correctness. This ensures that derived classes extend the functionality of their base classes without altering their expected behavior, resulting in predictable and reliable code.\\n\\n2. **Enhanced Code Flexibility and Reusability**: By adhering to LSP, developers can create robust and adaptable code that leverages polymorphism effectively. This enables the seamless replacement of base class references with derived class instances, promoting code reuse and the implementation of new features without modifying existing code.\\n\\n3. **Simplified Refactoring and Maintenance**: Following LSP makes it easier to refactor and maintain the codebase. Since subclasses can be safely used in place of their superclasses, developers can make implementation changes or add new functionality with confidence, knowing that other parts of the system will not be compromised.\\n\\n4. **Improved Testing Efficiency**: LSP facilitates unit testing by allowing subclasses to be tested in place of their parent classes. This ensures that all derived classes exhibit the expected behaviors defined by the base class, making it easier to create comprehensive tests for various implementations.\\n\\n5. **Clear Hierarchical Structure**: Applying LSP promotes a well-defined relationship between classes, leading to a more organized and coherent class hierarchy. This design approach aids in understanding the system's architecture, providing clearer documentation for how classes relate to each other and should be used.\\n\\nIn summary, the Liskov Substitution Principle is vital for creating maintainable, flexible, and reliable object-oriented systems that enable easier code extensibility and improve overall software quality. By adhering to LSP, developers can ensure that their systems are robust, adaptable, and easier to maintain over time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reference\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Open/Closed Principle means software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
